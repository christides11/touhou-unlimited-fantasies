**Unlimited Fantasies** is a hack-and-slash [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project) fangame with inspiration from DMC.

The game has a big focus on moddability, with support for new characters, stages, gamemodes, and more.

## Download   
Currently the game is hosted on itch.io in restricted mode until the core content is done. Currently only windows is available, but once it's stable there will be both Mac and Linux support.    
You can find the current build [here](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project) (password is 9).


## Modding Guide
To learn how to install and create mods, along with a reference of the available functions to you, I have created a guide [here](https://christides11.github.io/touhou-unlimited-fantasies/modGuide/index.html).

## Opening The Project
The project is currently built on **Unity 2019.4.18f1**.
If you want to edit the project itself, there's a few paid third party assets being used that are currently required. If you are just making mods, you can ignore this as you do not need to open this project to make them.

* Required
