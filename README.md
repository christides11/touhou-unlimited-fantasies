**Unlimited Fantasies** is a hack-and-slash Touhou fangame with a focus on modability. 

## Modding Guide
To learn how to install and create mods, along with a reference of the available functions to you, I have created a guide [here](https://christides11.github.io/touhou-unlimited-fantasies/modGuide/index.html).

## Opening The Project
The project is currently built on **Unity 2019.4.18f1**.
If you want to edit the project itself, there's a few paid third party assets being used that are currently required. If you are just making mods, you can ignore this as you do not need to open this project to make them.

* Required
  * [UMod](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/umod-2-0-58293) - Used for modding capability.
  * [Rewired](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676) - Used for handling input.
  * [Kinematic Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/kinematic-character-controller-99131) - Used for character movement handling.
  * [Third Persona Camera With Lock On](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/third-person-camera-with-lock-on-151550) - DMC styled camera control.
